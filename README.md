# Max-Tribble-Portfolio
My portfolio to show off more about me and my abilities
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

  I made this porfolio to give a little introduction of myself and show off some of my coding projects up to this point. I now have a central hub of information to show to anyone who may be interested. I greatly expanded my knowledge of flex box. I struggled for hours, but eventually figured out how to make things go where I want them and transition for smaller screens. Additionally, I was able to have some fun with the hover mechanics to add a little style to the nav bar at the top.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
